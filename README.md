# How to run

- Pre-requisites: Have Python and numpy installed, either on your host machine or in for example a conda environment

1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/Laura-Legat/csci4130-Cranfield-Collection.git`
2. On your system or in your conda environment (the same one with numpy installed), install the library for running Jupyter notebooks by running `pip install notebook` 
3. Run the `proj2_final_LEGAT_LEE.ipynb` file either from your IDE or text editor, or by running the command `jupyter notebook` in a terminal in the root folder of this project. For the latter case, a browser window will open up, from which the .ipynb file can be selected and executed
4. Execute all cells and read the result from the last cell. It shows the result of executing 20 random queries. For manually executing specific cells, run the `run_query` function
